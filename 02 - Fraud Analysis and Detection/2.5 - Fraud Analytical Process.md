## 2.5.1 The Fraud Analytics Process Model
![[fraud_analytics_process_model.png]]

**1. Identify Data Sources**:
*Data are the key ingredient* to any analytical exercises.

**2. Select the Data**:
Data selection has an **impact** on the *analytical models*:
- Data gathered in a staging area.
- Basic exploratory analysis.

**3. Clean the Data**:
*Get rid of all inconsistencies*, such as missing values and duplicate data.

**4. Transform the Data**:
<u>Additional transformations</u>: binning, alphanumeric to numeric coding, geographical aggregation, and so on.

**5. Analyze the Data**:
The analytical model is estimated on the *preprocessed and transformed data*.
**The actual fraud-detection model is built.**

**6. Interpret, Evaluate and Deploy the Model**:
The *model is interpreted and evaluated* by the fraud experts.

### 2.5.1.1 Possible Analysis Output
- **Trivial fraudulent patterns**: *Validation of the model*.
- **Unknown patterns**: provide *added insight and detection power* (“knowledge diamonds”).

Once the analytical model has been <u>appropriately validated and approved</u>, it can be put into *production*.

### 2.5.1.2 Additional Considerations
- How to represent the model output in a user-friendly way?
- How to integrate it with other applications?
- How to make sure the analytical model is appropriately monitored and back tested on an ongoing basis?

## 2.5.2 Key characteristics of successful fraud analytics models 

**A fraud-detection model must be thoroughly evaluated before being adopted.**

<u>Key characteristics of successful fraud analytics models</u>:
- [[#2 5 2 1 Statistical accuracy StatisticalAccuracy | Statistical accuracy.]]
- [[#2 5 2 2 Interpretability Interpretability | Interpretability.]]
- [[#2 5 2 3 Operational efficiency OperationalEfficiency | Operational efficiency.]]
- [[#2 5 2 4 Economical cost EconomicalCost | Economical cost.]]
- [[#2 5 2 5 Regulatory compliance RegulatoryCompliance | Regulatory compliance.]]

### 2.5.2.1 Statistical accuracy #StatisticalAccuracy 
#DEF **Detection power and correctness of the statistical
model in flagging suspicious cases.**
- Different Metrics

> We need to make sure that *<u>the model generalizes well
and is not overfitted to the historical data set</u>*.

### 2.5.2.2 Interpretability #Interpretability
#DEF **When a deeper understanding of the detected frauds is required, a fraud-detection model must be *interpretable*.**

<u>Model’s interpretability depends on the technique used.</u>
- **White-box models**: *Allow to understand* the underlying reasons why the model signals a case to be suspicious.
- **Black-box models**: Complex, *non interpretable models*.

### 2.5.2.3 Operational efficiency #OperationalEfficiency 
#DEF **Time** and **effort** that is required to:
- Collect and preprocess the *data*.
- To *evaluate the model*.
- *Monitor and backtest* the model, and re-estimate it.
- To *evaluate* whether *a case* is suspicious or not.

⚠️ When **cases need to be evaluated in real time** - > **operational efficiency is crucial** and is a **main concern during model performance assessment**.

### 2.5.2.4 Economical cost #EconomicalCost
#DEF **Developing and implementing a fraud-detection model
involves a significant cost to an organization**:
- To gather, preprocess, and analyze the *data*.
- To put the *resulting analytical models into production*.
- The *software, human, and computing resources*.
- *External data* to enrich the available in-house data. 

> **Cost-benefit analysis** to gain *insight* in the constituent factors of the *returns on investment of building an advanced fraud-detection system*.

**Security vs. Cost Balance**
1. *Direct costs*:
	- Management.
	- Operational.
	- Equipment.
2.  *Indirect costs (more relevant)*:
	- Less usability.
	- Slower performance.
	- Less privacy (due to security controls).
	- Reduced productivity (users are slower).

⚠️**More money =/=> More security**:
- <u>Very expensive, “unconfigured” Fraud Detection System</u>: 
	- Better not to have it.
- <u>Complex authentication that slows down users</u>:
	- Users will write passwords on stickies.
- etc...

### 2.5.2.5 Regulatory compliance #RegulatoryCompliance
#DEF **A fraud-detection model should be in line and comply with all applicable regulation and legislation.** (e.g., PSD2)

> Depending on the context *there may be internal or organization-specific and external regulation* that applies to the development and application of a model.

## 2.5.3 Challenges of developing fraud-detection models 
**Challenges**:
- [[#2 5 3 1 Dynamic nature of fraud NatureOfFraud | Dynamic nature of fraud.]]
- [[#2 5 3 2 Accuracy Accuracy | Accuracy.]]
- [[#2 5 3 3 Skewness of the data Skewness | Skewness of the data. ]]
- [[#2 5 3 4 Operational Efficiency OperationalEfficiency | Operational Efficiency.]]
- [[#2 5 3 5 Evaluation time and Big Data management EvaluationTime | Evaluation time and Big Data management.]]

### 2.5.3.1 Dynamic nature of fraud #NatureOfFraud
*Fraudsters* constantly try to <u>beat detection and prevention systems</u> by developing **new strategies and methods**.

> Adaptive analytical models for detection and prevention systems are **required**, in order to *detect and resolve fraud as soon as possible*.

### 2.5.3.2 Accuracy #Accuracy 
- **Good detection power**: Detect fraud as *accurately as possible*.
- **Not to miss out on too many fraud cases**, especially *involving a large amount or financial impact*.
- **Low false alarm rate**, to avoid harassing good customers and prevent accounts or transactions to be blocked unnecessarily.

The cost of missing a fraudulent case may be significant.

### 2.5.3.3 Skewness of the data #Skewness 
#DEF **Skewness**: We typically have *plenty of* historical examples of
*non-fraudulent cases*, but only a *limited number of fraudulent cases*.

⚠️ **Needle-in-a-haystack problem** -> might cause an analytical technique to experience difficulties in learning an accurate model.

### 2.5.3.4 Operational Efficiency #OperationalEfficiency 
#DEF **Limited amount of time available to reach a decision and let a transaction pass or not.**

Such a requirement clearly *impacts*:
- The *design* of the **operational IT systems**.
- The *design* of the **analytical model**.

### 2.5.3.5 Evaluation time and Big Data management #EvaluationTime
#DEF **Must be able to deal with the massive volumes of data that are available and need to be processed.**

- Must be *able to deal with the massive volumes of data* that are available and need to be processed.
- The *information or the variables* that are used by the model *should not take too long to be gathered or calculated*.
