## 6.1 Red Flags Intro
> [!QUOTE]  Grabosky and Duffield
>  Red flags is the **anomaly, deviation from normality** that is, a *variation from predictable patterns of behavior or, simply, something that seems out of place*.

Red-flags are **translated in expert rules** and included in a rule engine.
- Should be *documented* to ease investigations.

## 6.2 Credit card fraud red flags
- A **small payment followed by a large payment immediately after**:
	- A fraudster might first check whether the card is still active before placing a bet.
- **Regular rather small payments**, which is a *technique to avoid getting noticed*.

## 6.3 Telecommunications-related red flags
- *Long-distance access* followed by *reverse call charges accepted from overseas*.
- *High-volume usage over short periods* before disconnection.
- *A large volume of calls where one call begins shortly after the termination of another*.
- The *nonpayment of bills*.
