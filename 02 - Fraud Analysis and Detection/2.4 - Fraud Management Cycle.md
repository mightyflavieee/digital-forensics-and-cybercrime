##### Fraud Detection
Applying detection models on new, unseen observations and assigning a fraud risk to every observation.

##### Fraud Investigation
A human expert is often required to investigate suspicious, flagged cases, given the involved subtlety and complexity.

##### Fraud Confirmation
Determining true fraud label, possibly involving field research.

##### Fraud Prevention
Preventing fraud to be committed in the future.

##### Feedback Loop 
Newly detected cases should be added to the database of historical fraud cases, which is used to learn or induce the detection model.

## 2.4.1 Updates #ModelUpdates
Considering the **dynamic nature** of **fraud**, a **regular update** of the model is **recommendable**.

The frequency of **retraining** or **updating** the detection model **depends** on **several factors**:
- The **volatility** of the fraud behavior;
- The **detection power** of the current model;
- The amount of (similar) **confirmed cases** already **available** in the database;
- The **rate** at which new **cases** are being **confirmed**;
- The required **effort** to **retrain** the model.

> ==**Reinforcement learning**== ==> **continuously updates** the detection model by **learning** from the **newest observations**.
