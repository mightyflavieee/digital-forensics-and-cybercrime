## 5.1 The Fraud Analytics Process Model
![[fraud_analytics_process_model.png]]

**1. Identify Data Sources**:
*Data are the key ingredient* to any analytical exercises.

**2. Select the Data**:
Data selection has an **impact** on the *analytical models*:
- Data gathered in a staging area.
- Basic exploratory analysis.

**3. Clean the Data**:
*Get rid of all inconsistencies*, such as missing values and duplicate data.

**4. Transform the Data**:
<u>Additional transformations</u>: binning, alphanumeric to numeric coding, geographical aggregation, and so on.

**5. Analyze the Data**:
The analytical model is estimated on the *preprocessed and transformed data*.
**The actual fraud-detection model is built.**

**6. Interpret, Evaluate and Deploy the Model**:
The *model is interpreted and evaluated* by the fraud experts.

### 5.1.1 Possible Analysis Output
- **Trivial fraudulent patterns**: *Validation of the model*.
- **Unknown patterns**: provide *added insight and detection power* (“knowledge diamonds”).

Once the analytical model has been <u>appropriately validated and approved</u>, it can be put into *production*.

### 5.1.2 Additional Considerations
- How to represent the model output in a user-friendly way?
- How to integrate it with other applications?
- How to make sure the analytical model is appropriately monitored and back tested on an ongoing basis?
