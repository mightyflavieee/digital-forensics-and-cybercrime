# Anti-Fraud Strategy
## 1. Fraud Detection and Prevention Systems #AntiFraud
This systems serve to hinder as much as possible fraudsters and other criminals.
- #DEF **Fraud Detection**: we try to recognize or discover fraudulent activities (also called *ex-post approach*, after the fact has happened).

- #DEF **Fraud Prevention**:  we try to entirely avoid or reduce fraud (also called *ex-ante approach*, before the fact has happend).

#### 1.1 Fraud Prevention Examples #PreventionExamples
**Strong Customer Authentication (PSD2)** #PSD2

PSD2 is a european regulatory requirement designed to:
- Reduce fraud;
- More secure online payments. #SCA
	Achieved by meeting **SCA** (**S**ecure **C**ustomer **A**uthentication) **requirements**, namely authentication must use at least two of these factors:
			- Something the customer ==*knows*== (PIN, password ecc.);
			- Something the customer ==*has*== (phone, tablet ecc.);
			- Something the customer ==*is*== (fingerprint, face recognition ecc.). 

This standard is now required in every online payment within Europe except for these cases:
- Low risk transactions;
- Payments below 30â‚¬;
- Fixed-amount subscription;
- Transactions initiated by the seller;
- Trusted beneficiaries;
- Phone sales;
