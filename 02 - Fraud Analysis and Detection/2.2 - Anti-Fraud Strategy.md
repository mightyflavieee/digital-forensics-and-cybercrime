# Anti-Fraud Strategy
## 2. Fraud Detection and Prevention Systems #AntiFraud
This systems serve to hinder as much as possible fraudsters and other criminals.

- #DEF #FraudDetection **Fraud Detection**: we try to recognize or discover fraudulent activities (also called *ex-post approach*, after the fact has happened).

- #DEF #FraudPrevention **Fraud Prevention**:  we try to entirely avoid or reduce fraud (also called *ex-ante approach*, before the fact has happend).

#### 2.1 Fraud Prevention Examples #PreventionExamples
**Strong Customer Authentication (PSD2)** #PSD2

PSD2 is a european regulatory requirement designed to:
- Reduce fraud;
- More secure online payments. #SCA
	Achieved by meeting **SCA** (**S**ecure **C**ustomer **A**uthentication) **requirements**, namely authentication must use at least two of these factors:
			- Something the customer ==*knows*== (PIN, password ecc.);
			- Something the customer ==*has*== (phone, tablet ecc.);
			- Something the customer ==*is*== (fingerprint, face recognition ecc.). 

This standard is now required in every online payment within Europe except for these cases:
- Low risk transactions;
- Payments below 30â‚¬;
- Fixed-amount subscription;
- Transactions initiated by the seller;
- Trusted beneficiaries;
- Phone sales;
- Corporate payments.

Ways to secure a payment:
- 3D Secure
- 3D Secure 2
- Apple Pay or Google Pay

**Smart cards (or USB keys)** #SmartCards

#### 2.3 Fraud Detection and Fraud Prevention #AntiFraudLifecycle

Anti-Fraud strategies cycle:
1. Fraud Detection or Prevention mechanism deployed;
2. Fraudsters adapt and change their behavior;
3. Decrease in fraud detection or prevention power;
4. Back to point 1.

From this facts, we can infer that an effective anti-fraud strategy has 4 main points:
1. Prevention;
2. Detection;
3. Deterrence;
4. Response.

#### 2.4 Expert-based Approach #ExpertBasedApproach
#DEF Anti-Fraud approach built on the *domain knowledge* of the **fraud analyst**.

This approach is carried out by doing **manual investigations** of suspicious cases. 

Whenever a <u>new fraud scheme</u> is found, a **detailed investigation** is requiered in order to address how to tackle the new threat.
==> Once the new fraud mechanism is comprehended, the fraud detection and prevention mechanisms are extended.

##### Rule-based engine #RuleBasedEngine
==If-Then Rules:== With a rule-based engine, previously detected fraud patterns are defined in rules that are then applied to transactions and trigger an alert when a fraud may be committed. #IfThenRules

**Disadvantages:**
- Expensive to deploy;
	- Requieres manual input;
	- Difficult to update and mantain
	   ==> Every signaled case requires human follow-up and investigation.
- Fraudsters can learn the rules and circumvent them
- New fraud patterns are not automatically signaled

> A rule-based engine must continuously monitored, improved,and updated to remain effective.

**Rule-based engine VS Automated Fraud-Detection Systems**
- <u>Expert-based</u> fraud-detection system relies on human expert input, evaluation, and monitoring ==> labour intensive, requires human interventions.
- <u>Automated Fraud-Detection Systems</u> require less human involvement and could lead to a more efficient and effective system.

==However, expert knowledge remains crucial in order to build effective systems.==
