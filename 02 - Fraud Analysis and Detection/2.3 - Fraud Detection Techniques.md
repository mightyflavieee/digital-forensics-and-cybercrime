# 3. Fraud Detection Techniques #Detection
## 3.1 Intro
**Fraud-detection** <u>approaches have evolved and gained significant power over the past years.</u>
- Adopting powerful *statistically-based methodologies*.
- Analyzing *massive amounts of data*.

**Frauds remain a dynamic phenomenon hard to detect**

1. **Fraudsters *adapt*** their approaches to *commit fraud without being exposed.*
	Probe <u>fraud-detection and prevention systems</u>:
	- To *understand* their *functioning*.
	- To *discover* their *weaknesses*.

2. **Fraudsters *develop*** advanced strategies to **cover/blend in** their tracks to **avoid being detected** ~ *camouflage*

## 3.2 Fraud-Detection Techniques #Techniques
Need for *new techniques* that are able to **detect and address stealthy patterns.**
1. [[#3 2 1 Unsupervised learning techniques or descriptive analytics | Unsupervised learning]] or *descriptive analytics* techniques.
2. [[#3 2 2 Supervised learning techniques or predictive analytics | Supervised learning]] or *predictive analytics* techniques.

### 3.2.1 Unsupervised learning techniques or descriptive analytics 
**Unsupervised**: #Unsupervised
- They do **not** require *labeled observations*.
- Learn from <u>historical observation</u>:
	*Behavior that deviates from normal one* = **Detecting anomalies**.
	
Allow **detecting novel fraud pattern**, not discovered by expert systems since they:
- Are *different* in nature *from historical fraud*.
- Make *use* of *new, unknown mechanisms*.

<u>In the end</u>:

> **Complementary tool** to *<u>improve its expert rule-based fraud-detection system</u>*.

**Limitations**: #Limitations
Detect if a *new fraud mechanism* leads to *detectable deviations from normality*.
**Prone to deception**: *camouflage-like* fraud strategies.

> Need to be *<u>improved by complementing other tools</u>*.


### 3.2.2 Supervised learning techniques or predictive analytics
**Supervised**: #Supervised

#DEF **Learn from historical observations to retrieve patterns that allow differentiating normal and fraudulent behavior.**

Aim at *finding “known alarms”*: tracks that fraudsters *cannot* hide.

Can be applied to:
- **Predict fraud.**
- **Detect fraud.**
- **Estimate the amount of fraud.**

**Limitations**: #Limitations

1. They *need historical examples to learn* from (i.e., a labeled data set of historically observed fraud behavior).
2. *Low detection power against different and new fraud types* (i.e., not detected so far and not included in the historical database of fraud) -> detected by [[#3 2 1 Unsupervised learning techniques or descriptive analytics | descriptive analytics]].

**Complementarity of supervised and unsupervised methods**:
Use of *both methods* in developing a *powerful fraud-detection and prevention system*, they focus on *different aspects of fraud*.

### 3.2.3 Social network analysis
<u>Extends the abilities of the fraud-detection system</u> by *learning and detecting characteristics* of fraudulent behavior *in a network of linked entities*.
<u>Including an extra source of information in the analysis</u>, being the <u>relationships between entities</u>, it *contributes in uncovering particular patterns indicating fraud*.

### 3.3 Developing a fraud-detection system
1. **Expert-based rule engine**.
2. **Unsupervised learning systems**.
3. **Supervised learning systems**.

<u>The exact order of adopting the different techniques depend on the characteristics of the type of fraud</u>.
